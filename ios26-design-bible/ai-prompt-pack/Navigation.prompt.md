# Prompt: Implement Navigation (Bible-Compliant)

Task:
Build a Tab-based app scaffold with 3 tabs (Home, Search, Settings) and a navigation stack in each tab.

Rules:
- Use `TabView` + `NavigationStack` (SwiftUI) OR `UITabBarController` + `UINavigationController` (UIKit).
- Do not customize back button or gestures.
- Large titles for root screens; inline titles for pushed screens.
- Persist tab selection and navigation state (SceneStorage or state restoration).
- No custom nav bars.

Deliver:
- SwiftUI scaffold (preferred)
- UIKit scaffold
- Compliance declaration.
