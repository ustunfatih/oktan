# Prompt: Implement Text Fields & Forms (Bible-Compliant)

Task:
Create a sign-in form with Email + Password fields and a submit button.

Rules:
- Labels must be present (placeholder not a label).
- Use correct keyboard types and textContentType for autofill.
- Deferred validation (on submit or focus loss), not aggressive on every keystroke.
- Error messages must be readable and announced (VoiceOver).
- No fixed font sizes; Dynamic Type compatible.

Deliver:
- SwiftUI Form and UIKit equivalent
- Validation behavior
- Accessibility notes and compliance declaration.
