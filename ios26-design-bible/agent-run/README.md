# Agent Run Scripts (Codex / Claude Code)

Date: 2025-12-22

This folder provides:
- A canonical **system prompt**
- Reusable task templates
- Runner script templates (edit for your agent CLI)
- A verification checklist

Use these to keep AI agents from improvising UI decisions.


Team workflow:
- Put every change request in `tasks/`
- Run the agent against exactly one task file for repeatability.
