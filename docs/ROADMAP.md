## Future Considerations 🔮

### Essential Polish
- **Multi-Car Data Separation**: Currently `FuelEntry` does not store `carID`, so logs are shared across all cars. Needs SwiftData migration.

### Maybe Later
- Apple Watch companion app
- CarPlay integration
- Fuel price lookup by location
- Multiple cars support
